These are notes from [ISSYP](http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/outreach/students/programs/international-summer-school-young-physicists),
a theoretical physics summer school for high school students at Perimeter Institute.

Here is a useful link for learning python: http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english2e/

Here is a link for running small python notebooks online: http://tmpnb.org

  - To start a new notebook, click "New" -> "Python 2"

  - To save a notebook, I suggest first doing "Rename..." to give it a name other than "Untitled".  Then do "File" -> "Download As" -> "Notebook (.ipynb)"
    
    Note: On my apple laptop, the saved file ends up in the "Downloads" directory.

  - To load an old notebook, go to tmpnb.org and do "Upload" instead of "New".
