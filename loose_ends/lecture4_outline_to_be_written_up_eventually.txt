- just for fun let me tell you about chime
   - traditional radio telescope, e.g. gbt
   - interferometer
   - 1000 gbt's!
   - an experiment in using big networks of commodity computing, really pushing hardware to its limit
   - challenge: software!!
   - pulsar backend, timing known pulsars for gravity waves
   - fast radio bursts, currently a mystery
   - cosmology backend


- comment on python: I'm just showing you a minimal functionally complete subset of the syntax

- a few more python language features
   - indexing a list
   - len(l)
   - a loop which searches a list


- let's talk about the project
   - schedule/format?

   - timeline of the universe
       - age of the universe at matter-radiation equality
       - age of the universe when the CMB is generated
       - age of the universe at matter-Lambda equality
       - age of the universe today
       - what will happen in the future

- postmortem
   - what will happen in the future?

   - one thing you might mention in the poster: dark energy modifies the sign
       - accelerating universe observed in 1994

   - age of the universe is finite, so is the size of the observable universe
   - this is a sign that the big bang model is incomplete
