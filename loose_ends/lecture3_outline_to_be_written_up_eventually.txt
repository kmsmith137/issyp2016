  Python intro
    - I'll only teach a small subset of the python language, there is a huge amount to learn!
    - Print 'hello'
    - Print 2
    - Print 2.3
    - Comma-separated print
    - Calculator-like operation
        - Operators: 2+2
        - Watch out for division!
    - Assignment operators.  As an example let's look at this notebook.
        - Do the example of problem 1
 	- Turn students loose for a while

    - Now is a good time to mention save/restore

    - While loops
       - Boolean predicates
       - Examples to illustrate
          - Print hello N times
	  - With loop counter
          - Example with a floating-point counter
	     - Roundoff error
	  - Add up all the numbers from 1 to n and print the result
	  - You can put as much computation as you want inside the loop.  The loop ends when you change the indentation

    - Lists
       - Zero indexed
       - Indexing
       - Append
       - len(l)

    - Math functions are in numpy
    - Plotting is in matplotlib
    - More problems
    
    - Now a differential equation
    - Your turn...
