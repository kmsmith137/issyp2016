"A tour of modern cosmology"

- Geometry of the expanding universe.
  The modern theory of gravity (Einstein's general relativity) predicts an expanding
  universe.  In the first part we'll give a precise definition of what this means,
  and discuss observables and paradoxes associated with the expanding universe.

- Thermal history of the universe, dark matter and dark energy.
  Modern cosmology is a data-heavy subfield of physics, and observables such as the
  cosmic microwave background are sensitive to the thermal history of the universe
  going back to very early times, a few seconds after the big bang when the temperature
  of the universe was ~1 MeV.  Through study of these observables, we have found
  surprising new phenomena (such as dark energy and dark matter) whose unknown
  microscopic descriptions are among the deepest unsolved problems in physics.

- Fluctuations and the big bang origin of structure.
  As the universe expands, small fluctuations in the density of matter grow via
  gravitational instability.  The early universe is nearly homogeneous, but its
  small inhomogeneities are the seeds for galaxies and other large inhomogeneous
  structures today.  This raises the question of where the initial inhomogeneities
  came from.  One successful theory is that they were generated by a quantum
  mechanical process, similar to Hawking evaporation of black holes, in a very
  early stage of the universe dominated by a set of fields very different from
  our Standard Model.
